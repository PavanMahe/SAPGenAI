test_post='''📢 Attention Gurgaon residents! ⚠️

Can we talk about the pathetic state of our roads and water flooding for a moment? 🗑️🤢 
It seems like the local authorities have forgotten about our beloved public area on Sector 65 Road. 
Seriously, has anyone seen the piles of rubbish and litter scattered everywhere which causes massive water flooding when rain comes? 
🚯 It's like a swimming pool next to our doorstep! I mean, who needs to fix broken roads, blocked man holes, do you agree?

📍 Sector 65 Road, Gurgaon

It's mildly infuriating how we pay our taxes and yet we have to put up with this filth! 🤬 I'm not asking for Presidential Palace-like cleanliness, but a basic level of hygiene wouldn't hurt. 
Hopefully, the authorities will wake up from their slumber and do something about it ASAP. Let's keep our fingers crossed! 🤞
